"""Tests for controller state management.

These tests exercise end-to-end observable behavior through the event-driven API (handle_event).
They focus on:
- Full workflows (submit job -> dispatch tasks -> complete/fail)
- Important edge cases (retry exhaustion, worker failure cascades, failure domains)
- Final state verification rather than intermediate steps
