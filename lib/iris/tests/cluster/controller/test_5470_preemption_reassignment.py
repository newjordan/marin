"""Regression test for issue #5470: TPU placement collision after preemption.

Verify the scheduler does not reassign a TPU slice while sibling kill RPCs
for the slice are still in flight. Worker capacity is derived from
unfinished worker-bound attempts (``finished_at_ms IS NULL``), so
producer-side cancel/preempt does not free the slice — only the heartbeat
path's terminal finalization does.

Production incident timeline (Incident B, v5p-256):
  09:14:31  lr0.5  assigned -> slice 389585fe
  09:14:34  lr0.67 assigned -> slice 2e06c8f1  (separate slice, correct)
  18:43:32  lr0.5  reassigned -> slice 8996b868 (after preemption)
  18:43:57  lr0.5  TERMINATED -- task 28 hit 502 during uv sync
  18:43:58  lr0.67 reassigned -> slice 8996b868 (COLLISION -- 1s after decommit)
