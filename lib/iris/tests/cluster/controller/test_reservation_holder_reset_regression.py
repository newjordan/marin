"""Regression test for reservation-holder reset misapplied to non-holder tasks.

Bug (iris-outage 2026-04): when a worker hosting both a reservation-holder task
and one or more non-holder tasks fails, `_remove_failed_worker` sometimes
applies the holder-reset branch (DELETE from task_attempts, preemption_count=0,
started_at_ms=NULL, current_attempt_id=-1) to NON-holder tasks.

Observable production fallout: dashboard shows zero attempts / no run history
for tasks that clearly ran; worker attribution lost; preemption_count wiped.

This test pins the correct behavior: a non-holder task that was running on a
failed worker must go through `_terminate_task` (preemption_count increments,
attempt row is preserved with a terminal state, not DELETEd). See
transitions.py:2030-2111.
