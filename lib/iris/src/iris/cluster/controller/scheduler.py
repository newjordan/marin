"""Pure task-to-worker matching without threading, dispatch, or state mutation.

Implements scheduler back-pressure to limit concurrent setup operations per worker.
When many tasks are assigned simultaneously, their uv sync commands can overwhelm
the worker. The max_building_tasks_per_worker setting limits how many tasks can
be in BUILDING state on each worker, preventing resource exhaustion.

The scheduler operates exclusively on scheduler-owned types (JobRequirements,
WorkerCapacity, SchedulingContext) and has ZERO runtime imports from controller
state. Callers project worker rows into ``WorkerSnapshot`` (via
``worker_snapshot_from_row``) at the boundary before invoking
``create_scheduling_context``.

        """Match pending tasks to available workers.

        Pure function - does not mutate any external state. Returns assignments
        for the controller to execute.

        Coscheduled jobs are processed first: all tasks must be assigned atomically
        to workers sharing the same group_by attribute value. If not enough workers
        are available in any group, the job stays pending.

        Non-coscheduled jobs use first-fit algorithm, skipping tasks that don't
        fit any worker. The algorithm prevents head-of-line blocking: if a large
        task at the front of the queue doesn't fit, smaller tasks behind it can
        still be scheduled.

        Per-job dedup: tasks of the same non-coscheduled job share one
        `JobRequirements`, so constraint matching and soft-score ranking are
        hoisted once per job. Once a job's first task in this pass fails to
        find a worker, capacities only decrease and assignment_counts only
        increase for the remainder of the pass — so all of that job's
        remaining same-req tasks would also fail. We mark the job exhausted
        and skip them, turning the inner work from O(pending x workers) into
        O(jobs x workers + min(pending, workers)).

        Implements back-pressure by limiting concurrent BUILDING tasks per worker.
