"""Force-requeue any coscheduled job whose tasks are split across slices.

Pre-fix versions of ``ControllerTransitions.apply_state_updates`` /
``apply_direct_provider_updates`` / ``_remove_failed_worker`` did not
cascade transient task failures to the rest of a coscheduled job. When
one task hit a TPU-init failure (or its host died) the failed task
returned to PENDING alone; the scheduler's
``_find_coscheduled_assignments`` then placed the retry on **any**
worker with free capacity, including a worker on a different ``tpu-name``
group. The job ended up split across two physical TPU slices, the SPMD
collective could not form, and the run hung or crashed.

The code-side fix in ``transitions.py`` prevents new splits. This
migration heals any coscheduled job that's *currently* split:

  - find every coscheduled job whose active-task workers span more than
    one ``md_tpu_name`` value;
  - decommit each such task's resources from its worker
    (``committed_cpu_millicores`` / ``committed_mem_bytes`` /
    ``committed_gpu`` / ``committed_tpu``);
  - mark each in-flight attempt PREEMPTED with ``finished_at_ms`` set;
  - reset each task to PENDING with ``current_worker_id`` cleared.

After the controller starts, the next scheduling cycle re-coschedules
the entire job atomically onto a single ``tpu-name`` group via the
fixed ``_find_coscheduled_assignments`` path.

Reservation-holder jobs are skipped: they don't commit worker resources
and never participate in a slice.

Idempotent — once split jobs are healed, the WHERE clause matches
nothing on subsequent runs.
