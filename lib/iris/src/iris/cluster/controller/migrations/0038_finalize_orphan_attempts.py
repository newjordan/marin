"""Finalize orphan task_attempts rows left active by the cancel_job bug.

Pre-fix versions of ``ControllerTransitions.cancel_job`` updated tasks /
jobs / workers but never finalized the corresponding ``task_attempts``
row. The current attempt stayed at state RUNNING/BUILDING/ASSIGNED with
``finished_at_ms = NULL`` long after the task itself went terminal,
which made the dashboard report killed tasks as still occupying their
old worker — surfacing as bogus "two TPU jobs on one worker"
co-scheduling violations even when committed_* accounting was correct.

This migration heals two classes of stale rows so the post-restart
dashboard matches reality:

1. **Task is terminal but attempt is still active.** Mark the attempt
   PREEMPTED and stamp ``finished_at_ms``.
2. **Attempt is superseded** (``attempt_id != tasks.current_attempt_id``)
   but still active. Same fix; the controller already routes new heartbeats
   for the live attempt and ignores stale attempt RPCs via the
   ``attempt.state in TERMINAL_TASK_STATES`` short-circuit in
   ``apply_state_updates``.

Idempotent — the WHERE clause filters by current state so rerunning is
a no-op once applied.
