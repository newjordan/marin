"""Drop the cached committed-resource columns on ``workers``.

Worker resource usage is now derived from unfinished worker-bound
``task_attempts`` (``worker_id IS NOT NULL AND finished_at_ms IS NULL``)
via ``reads.scheduler.resource_usage_by_worker``. The ``committed_*``
counters were a redundant cache that drifted out of sync with reality on
producer/heartbeat path splits — see #5470 — so they are removed.

SQLite supports ``ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN`` since 3.35.
