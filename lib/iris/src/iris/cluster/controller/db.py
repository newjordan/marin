"""SQLAlchemy-backed controller database wrapper.

Hosts the SA ``Engine`` factories, the ``Tx`` wrapper, and the two
transaction context managers (``write_transaction`` / ``read_snapshot``).

The engine is split into a **write engine** and a **read engine**:

* The write engine uses pool size 1 so writes are funneled through a
  single connection. Serialization between writers is enforced by an
  external ``threading.RLock`` passed into ``write_transaction``.
* The read engine uses ``QueuePool(pool_size=32, max_overflow=4)`` with
  ``PRAGMA query_only = ON`` **pinned at connect time**. Pinning avoids
  toggling the pragma on every ``read_snapshot`` call.

Both engines use ``isolation_level="AUTOCOMMIT"`` so callers issue
``BEGIN`` / ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` / ``COMMIT`` / ``ROLLBACK`` explicitly.

Post-commit hooks registered via ``Tx.register`` fire *under the write
lock*, after ``COMMIT``. A concurrent thread cannot observe the
SQL-committed-but-cache-not-yet-updated window because the lock is held
until every hook has run.

        The source DB uses WAL journal mode, but the backup API copies
        the WAL flag into the destination header.  We switch the
        destination to DELETE mode so the result is a single
        self-contained file (no -wal/-shm sidecars) that survives
        compression and remote upload without corruption.

        We also set ``auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL`` on the backup and run one
        incremental vacuum pass so controllers restoring from this
        checkpoint start in incremental mode without needing a full
        VACUUM at boot.  This is a single-pass operation against the
        already-written backup file -- no redundant copy is required.

        The backup runs through a dedicated read-only source connection,
        so writers on the write engine proceed concurrently under SQLite's
        WAL semantics -- no controller-level lock is held for the
        duration of the copy.  Batched page copying (``pages=500``)
        yields between steps so a sustained write stream cannot starve
        the backup.
