"""Projection registry: write-through caches owning specific tables.

Each projection instance registers itself in :data:`PROJECTIONS` at
construction. Stage 12 wires :func:`assert_owned_tables_not_externally_written`
into ``ControllerDB.__init__`` to enforce the ``@writes_to`` invariant:
no Projection-owned table may be mutated (directly or via FK cascade)
from outside its owning Projection.

Re-exporting the entity submodules at import time ensures that every
projection instance — and every Projection class used by the startup
check's ``__qualname__`` exemption — is materialized before the check
runs. Without this, the check would silently pass on a half-loaded
registry.

    For projection-owned tables, all SQL mutations must flow through the
    Projection so the in-memory dict can be updated atomically. A write
    function that bypasses the Projection (or whose FK cascade silently
    mutates the table) leaves the dict stale.

    The exemption is by ``fn.__qualname__``: a method whose qualified
    name starts with ``<OwningProjection>.`` is allowed to mutate the

    Projection-owned table must call the Projection's invalidation method
    inline; they should then drop the Projection-owned table from their
    ``cascades_into`` declaration so the linkage is documented at the
